# mmp-calc
Calculate MMP! 


`mmp-calc` is a free-and-open-source (MIT Licence) Python script for calculating the results of an election conducted using a form of mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation (also known as the Additional Member System in the UK).  

`mmp-calc` allows a user to enter the number of seats won in single-member constituencies, and then to calculate the allocation of proportional seats using either of the most frequently used electoral quotas: d'Hondt (as in eg Scotland) or St-LaguÃ« (as in eg New Zealand).  There is no limit to the amount of parties or seats which can be calculated, other than the processing power of the machine using the script.

As a demonstration of how to use `mmp-calc`, we will calculate the regional (proportional) seats for the 'Highlands and Islands' region of the Scotland in the 2016 Scottish elections.  The vote and seat data used in this example come from the official House of Commons Library Briefing on the results of the election, [which can be accessed by clicking on this link](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7599/?doing_wp_cron=1593138584.9657280445098876953125).   

In Scottish parliament elections, each region proportionally allocates 7 seats on the basis of the 'party' vote in that region, taking into account seats already won in the single-member plurality constituency seats (of which there are 8 in the Highlands and Islands region).   This is calculated using the d'Hondt formula of
